# The Grand JavaScript Seniority Showdown

Welcome one, welcome all! Step right up and see the most thrilling, the most stupendous, the most sensational spectacle of JavaScript performance!

Here we test the mettle of three functions representing three levels of JavaScript coder maturity - the `junior`, the `medior`, and the `senior`.

Will the `senior` justify its title, or will it be toppled by the young and eager `junior`? Find out in this breathtaking contest!

## The Contestants :muscle:

We have three fearless contestants:

1. `junior` - A bit old-school, loves the traditional for loop. It's slow and steady, but will it win the race?
2. `medior` - A little smarter, leverages the `Array.fill().map()` combo. Has a lot to prove today.
3. `senior` - The cool kid, uses the ES6 spread operator with `Array.keys()`. Is it as fast as it is slick? Let's find out!

## The Showdown :boom:

Each function is tasked with creating an array of a whopping 100,000 elements! Who will do it the fastest? Who will use the least memory? 

Our trusty benchmark suite will tell us the truth. No LinkedIn exaggerations here!

## Results :trophy:

Results are announced after each thrilling cycle, with op/sec rates and memory usage. Who will emerge as the fastest? Will the `senior` function be an impostor, or will it live up to its title? 

## Run It Yourself :running:

Grab your popcorn, sit back, and watch the JavaScript performance showdown unfold!

Note: This repository is intended for fun and learning purposes. In real life, the seniority of a JavaScript developer cannot be determined by how they create a range of numbers. ;)
